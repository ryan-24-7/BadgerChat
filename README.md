# BadgerChat
This is a project created for the CS571: Building User Interfaces Course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
The project was developed entirely in React.JS.

BadgerChat is a social chatroom where students and other individuals affiliated with the University of Wisconsin-Madison can come together to post and view messages across a number of different chatrooms.
There are 7 different chatrooms available, furthermore, this project also includes user authentication functionality.

To test out the project, please clone it and then run npm install followed by npm run dev. This should start a local server where you can interact with the Badger Chatrooms and test out the functionality.
